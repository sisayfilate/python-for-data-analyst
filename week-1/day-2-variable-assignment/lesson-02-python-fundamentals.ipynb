    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we understand a bit about how to use our terminal and how to clone GitHub repositories from our learn lessons, we should talk about the Jupyter Notebooks that will run most of the content in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to activate your conda virtual environment in your terminal first by typing `source activate learn-env`. Then type `jupyter notebook` in your command line and press enter. Next, your default browser will open a new window or tab and you will see the list of files that are in your current directory (*remember we want to be in the GitHub repo directory that we just downloaded*). \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** *To stop a Jupyter Notebook, go to your command line where the notebook is running and press the **control** key + the letter **C*** (**`ctrl`**+**`c`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second step is to click on the `index.ipynb` file which is the Jupyter Notebook we will be using in this and future labs and lessons. This will open a new tab where we will see the same content from learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background on Jupyter \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a web application that allows someone to create and work with documents that have live code.  It's a very popular tool among data scientists, as it allows for both explanations of thinking behind code as well as the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook itself consists of cells. Double click on this content to see what I mean. Once we double click on a cell, we are in insert mode. This means that we are able to edit the cells, just as you would if this were a word document. We can tell that we are in insert mode because of the green border around the cell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After entering insert mode for this cell, change some content. Don't worry about what you change as we can always undo it. We can revert our changes to a cell by making sure that we are still in insert mode and by pressing `command + z` on a Mac or `control + z` on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get out of insert mode and see the effect of our changes, press `shift + enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding and Deleting Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen, to alter the contents of a cell we simply double click on that cell, bringing us into insert mode, and then change the contents.  Now let's see how to add, and delete cells from escape mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding cells\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wish to quickly add a new cell we can do so with the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure we are not in insert mode, but in escape mode\n",
    "    * *Remember we can tell we are in insert mode when we have a green border around our cell.*\n",
    "    * To get out of insert mode and into escape mode, press shift + enter.  Another option is to press the escape key.\n",
    "    * You will no longer see a cell bordered in green.\n",
    "* Then press the letter `b` to create a new cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deleting cells\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a cell we once again should be in escape mode, and then press the `x` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we'll want a way to undo our deletion.  From escape mode, you can press `z` to undo deletion of a cell.  Note that this is different from `cmd + z`.  Pressing `cmd + z` while in insert mode undoes any changes inside of a cell while, whether these changes be deletions or text insertions.  Pressing `z` from escape mode undoes the deletion of a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to escape mode and press `x`.  This cell disappears!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then bring it back with `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The current cell and every other cell in this lesson has been a markdown cell, meaning that it allows us to write text and stylize that text. For example, if you surround some text with two asterisks (`**`) on both sides, the text `**becomes bold**`. That's markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can also have a type of code. If we are writing in a cell that is for Python code, everything in that cell must be valid Python or we will see an error.\n",

We'll go into a large amount of detail about working with a Jupyter Notebook in Python, but the main takeaway is this: if we see a Python cell, we should press `shift + enter` on that cell. \n",
